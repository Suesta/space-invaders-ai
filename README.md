# AI-enhanced Space Invaders 🚀🎮

This project implements a fully customized **Space Invaders** game in Python with 5 increasingly difficult levels, enhanced with intelligent behavior and modular architecture.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Object-Oriented Architecture (OOP)
- AI-like behavior and attack patterns for enemies
- Game physics, hitboxes and collision detection
- Multilevel game progression
- Life counter and bullet management

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `JocDefinitiu.py`: Main game loop and orchestrator
- `nau.py`: Player spaceship and controls
- `enemic.py`: Enemy behavior and movement
- `bala.py`: Bullet creation and collisions
- `heart.py`: Life tracking system

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python
- Pygame (or native modules, depending on version)
- Custom physics and object control
